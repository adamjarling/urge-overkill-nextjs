### INTERVIEW WITH GUITARIST / BASSIST ADAM ARLING (THE LAST VEGAS, FURBABY, WARRIOR SOUL, URGE OVERKILL)

Date: December 6, 2020
Interviewer: Olivier

MANY PEOPLE WILL KNOW GUITARIST ADAM ARLING AS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE LAST VEGAS WHO HAVE RELEASED SEVEN STUDIO ALBUMS INCLUDING ‘WHATEVER GETS YOU OFF’ WHICH FINISHED AT #1 ON THE SLEAZE ROXX’S TOP TEN ALBUMS OF 2009 AND #7 ON THE SLEAZE ROXX READERS’ TOP 20 ALBUMS OF 2009.

I KNEW THAT ARLING PLAYED IN A NUMBER OF OTHER BANDS FROM TIME TO TIME BUT DIDN’T REALIZE HOW HIS GIGS AS WARRIOR SOUL GUITARIST AND URGE OVERKILL BASSIST WOULD TAKE HIM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

DURING THE DOWNTIME CAUSED BY THE COVID PANDEMIC, ARLING HAS FOUND AN OUTLET FOR HIS CREATIVE JUICES WITH FURBABY, WHICH IS A PROJECT THAT HAS HIM ALSO HANDLING LEAD VOCAL DUTIES WHILE GETTING SOME HELP FROM SOME OF HIS MUSICIAN FRIENDS.

SLEAZE ROXX CAUGHT UP WITH ARLING FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A FUN AND INTERESTING INTERVIEW WHICH EVEN INCLUDES AN AXL ROSE ‘MELTDOWN’ STORY.
